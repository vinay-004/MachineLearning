\section{Introduction}
This document illustrates the use of BibTeX\@.  You may want to refer to
\cite{ahu61} or \cite{ab94} or \cite{m85}.  Or you may want to cite a
specific page in a reference, like this: see \citet[p.~199]{m85}.  Or
perhaps you want to cite more than one paper by Maskin: \cite{m85, m99}.
Or you want to make a parenthetical reference to one or more articles, in which case the \verb+\citealt+ command omits the parentheses around the year (\citealt{ahu61}).
